RFM modeling increases a business’ ability to prevent churn by using fundamental marketing principles of segmentation, targeting, and positioning, which help understand the following:

Customer segmentation allows you to divide potential customer groups allowing businesses to talk to them separately. It helps answer the questions:

Are all my customers similar?
What differentiates them from each other?
Who is my most likely customer?
Targeting involves understanding the routines and customer behavior of these segments, allowing you to consider and choose the ideal way to speak to them. It helps answer the questions:

Where do my customers interact with the brand?
What’s the best time, place, medium, and format to talk to them about my brand?
Positioning helps you understand how to talk about your product/service, in order to maximize customer lifetime value. It helps answer the question:

What type of brand message will increase and ensure brand trust?
What type of brand message is likely to induce a purchase interaction?
Principles of segmentation, targeting, and positioning have been used for ages in the field of marketing. However with the advent of data analytics, and the creation of number-driven models like RFM, the scope of these principles has widened tremendously. Today, businesses can go beyond the above questions with the help of RFM analysis and get answers to highly specific questions such as:

Who are my best customers?
Which customer has the potential to buy more?
Which customer has been churned out/has lapsed?
Which customer can the business afford to ignore to effectively utilize budgets?
Which customer can be converted by creating value through promotions?
Which customer is likely to be loyal in the near future?
The RFM model allows businesses to gain key customer actionable insights, through convenient valuable insights, and frame business strategy with those insights at the heart of every decision. The model allows the business to gain perspective on what their brand means to the existing customers, helps businesses manage customer perceptions, and also translates positive sentiment into purchase opportunities.

Businesses can recognize critical customer segments like churn-risk users, and create a bespoke marketing plan, specifically designed for customer retention.

Simultaneously, a business can also use the model to maximize monetary value, the potential of active customers, by creating customized offerings, making them feel like high-value customers.

Why does RFM work for customer segmentation?
The RFM model is fundamentally built using principles of data-driven marketing. Data-driven marketing has fundamentally transformed how marketing works ever since its inception, as it allows the RFM analysis of large sets of customer data like never before.

This has led to increased accuracy in understanding customers and enhanced ability to creatively customize messaging. The rise of automation in marketing technology has led to increased granularity and personalization, leading to enhanced relevance of each brand message.

Origins of RFM
RFM traces its origin back to 1995 when it was cited by Bult and Wansbeek in an issue of Marketing Science. Used in the context of direct mail, it showcased how the three criteria could be used to better estimate demand, reduce costs on printing and shipping, and lead to enhanced returns. With the rising sophistication of computing power, RFM has become easier to apply in businesses due to the computerized customer histories of today.

Applying Pareto Principle to RFM
The model is linked with the famous Pareto Principle, which says that 80% of total results are driven by the top 20% of causes. When applied to marketing, it means that 80% of your total sales are likely to come from your top 20% of customers. Regular customers will always be high contributors to business monetary value, and hence that customer segmentation is highly critical for business performance.

Role of RFM in Customer Retention
Small businesses constantly face the pressure of acquiring new customers, which defines their growth and trajectory and are prone to spending high amounts of money to acquire them. A business cannot sustain itself without customers, and while acquisition is a critical part of business strategy, customer retention plays a bigger role in ensuring high returns for the business.

Customer retention depends on customer satisfaction with the product, the service provided by the business, and the interactions the customer has with the business, hence making them feel valued.

Low churn rates are the easiest way to maintain and grow business, as it enables a reliance on customer satisfaction, and also the creation of positive word of mouth by customers. Now, with the RFM model, each segment customers can have their own customer journeys based on personalization. This helps create value and establish loyalty and trust.

RFM: Personalization and Focused Use of Marketing Budgets
The digital world is a buyer’s market, with a plethora of options available to a user at their fingertips. Brands are constantly jostling and fighting for a share of the customer’s wallet and attention. In such an atmosphere, understanding customer behavior and segmenting them into distinct groups, help businesses focus their marketing efforts on relevant customers.

With the power of social media at their fingertips to express displeasure and the ease of choosing alternatives, customer expectations regarding the quality of brand interactions are high. Hence creating relevant messaging, tailored to user behavior has become the norm.
